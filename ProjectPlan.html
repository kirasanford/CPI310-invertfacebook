     Our project plan is to have a new minigame created every two weeks
     and have debugging done on it within the following third week.
     In time this should lead to a well-designed website.
     Chat messaging will be incorporated during the debugging phase

     If the time permits, the features that we would like to add a search bar and a
     way to messages images. We are not sure if these are all the features that
     we would like to add, but we know this would be a good general starting
     point for improvements.
     </p>
     <p class = "specOne">
 	 If the time is lost, the features that we may have to let go would be
 	 quantity of minigames. Our goal is to have five minigames a player
 	 can switch through. If there isn’t enough time, we’ll only shoot
 	 for four, or three, we really hope to have at least three games.
