    Our project is aiming to create a simplified, inverted version of Facebook games.
    Where Facebook aims to connect people and then encourage them to play games,
    we plan to encourage people to play games and then connect with people.
    After logging in, users will be able to save their scores and keep track
    of their achievements with the few exclusive games that we have made for the site.
    Games include clicker-based games, trivia quizzes, and other such simple games. We 
	have included a few screenshots of similar games to help demonstrate what the site
	may include.
