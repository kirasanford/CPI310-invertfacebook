		<p class="projectP">
		Our project is aiming to create a simplified, inverted version of Facebook games.
		Where Facebook aims to connect people and then encourage them to play games,
		we plan to encourage people to play games and then connect with people.

		<h2 class = "welcomesub"> Our Promise</h2>
        <p class="projectP">
		After logging into our site, users will be able to save their scores and share them with
		friends who are members of the site. Users will also be able to gain achievements similar
		to that of game engines like Steam. There will also be an exclusive chat for each game, so 
		users will be able to intereact with other people who are playing the same game currently to
		create a sense of community. Games include clicker-based games, trivia quizzes, and other such
		simple games we were able to program over the course of the semester. We	have included a few 
		screenshots of similar games that we have drawn inspiration from to help demonstrate what the site
		may include.

        <p class="projectP">
		We want to connect people playing single-player, casual games, by providing them the option to
		interact with other people who are actively playing the same game.
